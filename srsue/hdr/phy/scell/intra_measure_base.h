   * The intra-cell measurement has 5 different states:
   *  - idle: it has been initiated and it is waiting to get configured to start capturing samples. From any state
   *          except quit can transition to idle.
   *  - wait: waits for the TTI trigger to transition to receive
   *  - receive: captures base-band samples for intra_freq_meas_len_ms and goes to measure.
   *  - measure: enables the inner thread to start the measuring function. The asynchronous buffer will transition to
   *             wait as soon as it has read the data from the buffer.
   *  - quit: stops the inner thread and quits. Transition from any state measure state.
