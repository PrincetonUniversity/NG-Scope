Here is some coding notes during the develop of the NGScope

1, Naming Specifications
  for naming the API that should be called inside the library, we should use srsran_ngscope_

  for naming the functions that only be called inside the NGS-Scope, we should use ngscope_

  for naming the other functions, exclude both


Coding Progress
  1, ngscope_dci  
      we have finished change the name of the functions
      we also finished remove the depedency on ue_dl

  2, ngscope_search_space
      we have finished change the name of the functions
      we also finished remove the depedency on ue_dl

  3, ngscope_st
      we didn't finish the name of the functions yet, since we don't know whether we need to call those functions outside of NG-Scope
