 * This class manages the mapping between logical and physical channels.
 * A physical channel in this class is a carrier index in the radio class, which
 * has multiple antenna ports all tuned to the same frequency.
 *
 * Every group of channels tuned associated with a carrier go through the same band-pass filter. This
 * class then manages the allocation of frequencies to these group of channels.
 *
 * The same object is reused for the reception and transmission.
 *
 * When the UE wants to tune a logical channel to a new frequency it requests this class
 * to provide an available channel that supports this frequency. At that point,
 * that channel can not be used anymore until a call to release().
