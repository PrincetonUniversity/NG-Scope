#The list of files

--> dci_log.c
The library for dci logging and also the implementation of dci_logger thread.

--> cell_status.c  
The implemetation of the cell status handling thread. This thread put the received dci messages into the corresponding container.

--> dci_ring_buffer.c
The implementation of the dci handling library. Mainly, this lib focuses on putting dci into the data structures.

--> dci_decoder.c
The implementation of the dci decoder.

--> status_tracker.c
The implementation of the status tracker thread, which receives the dci from the dci-decoder and dispatch the received dci to the corresonding handling thread, for example, the dci recording thread and the cell-status tracking thread. It is the central hub of the dci message handling. The dci received from all aggregated cells (all USRPs) will be forwarded to this thread.

--> radio.c
The library for handling radio (usrp) related functions, such open the radio and close the radio.

--> task_scheduler.c
The implementation of the task scheduler. Task scheduler demodulates the signal, divides the signal into subframes and forward the subframe to an idle dci-decoder.

--> thread_exit.c
The library that should be called when the whole program terminates. We implement this because NG-scope is mutli-threading. Without proper exiting mechanism, the program could crash easily.

--> load_config.c
The library that loads the configurations.

--> task_sf_ring_buffer.c
The library of the subframe ring buffer.

--> skip_tti.c
The library that handles the tti skipping.

--> status_plot.c
The plotting library

--> time_stamp.c
The library to get the time stamps
 
--> ngscope_main.c
The main function
